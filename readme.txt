In this HW, I will try to recognize handwritten digits. Use PyTorch or TensorFlow to design and train
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the MNIST dataset, which has 28×28 grayscale images of
handwritten digits. Use the libraries below:
• PyTorch: torchvision.datasets.MNIST(...)
• TensorFlow: tf.keras.datasets.mnist

Dataset is implemented on models
